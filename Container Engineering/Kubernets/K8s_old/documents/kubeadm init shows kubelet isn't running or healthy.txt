The issue is it displays the warning:

[kubelet-check] It seems like the kubelet isn't running or healthy.
[kubelet-check] The HTTP call equal to 'curl -sSL http://localhost:10248/healthz' failed with error: Get http://localhost:10248/healthz: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:10248: connect: connection refused.

The problem was cgroup driver. Kubernetes cgroup driver was set to systems but docker was set to systemd. So I created '/etc/docker/daemon.json' and added below:

{
"exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
}

Then

 systemctl daemon-reload
 systemctl restart docker
 systemctl restart kubelet

Run kubeadm init or kubeadm join again.
